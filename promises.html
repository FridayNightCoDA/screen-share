          <h1>The Twelve Promises of Co-Dependents Anonymous</h1>
<p>I can expect a miraculous change in my life by working the program of Co-Dependents Anonymous. As I make an honest effort to work the Twelve Steps and follow the Twelve Traditions...</p>
<ol>
<li>I know a new sense of belonging. The feeling of emptiness and loneliness will disappear.</li>
<li>I am no longer controlled by my fears. I overcome my fears and act with courage, integrity and dignity.</li>
<li>I know a new freedom.</li>
<li>I release myself from worry, guilt, and regret about my past and present. I am aware enough not to
repeat it.</li>
<li>I know a new love and acceptance of myself and others. I feel genuinely lovable, loving and loved.</li>
<li>I learn to see myself as equal to others. My new and renewed relationships are all with equal partners.</li>
<li>I am capable of developing and maintaining healthy and loving relationships. The need to control and
manipulate others will disappear as I learn to trust those who are trustworthy.</li>
<li>I learn that it is possible to mend - to become more loving, intimate and supportive. I have the choice
of communicating with my family in a way which is safe for me and respectful of them.</li>
<li>I acknowledge that I am a unique and precious creation.</li>
<li>I no longer need to rely solely on others to provide my sense of worth.</li>
<li>I trust the guidance I receive from my Higher Power and come to believe in my own capabilities.</li>
<li>I gradually experience serenity, strength, and spiritual growth in my daily life.</li>
