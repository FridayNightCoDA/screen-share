| Are extremely loyal, remaining in harmful situations too long.                                     | I am committed to my safety and leave situations that feel unsafe or are inconsistent with my goals.                                                        |
| Compromise their own values and integrity to avoid rejection or anger.                             | I am rooted in my own values, even if others don’t agree or become angry.                                                                                   |
| Put aside their own interests in order to do what others want.                                     | I consider my interests and feelings when asked to participate in another’s plans.                                                                          |
| Are hypervigilant regarding the feelings of others and take on those feelings.                     | I can separate my feelings from the feelings of others. I allow myself to experience my feelings and others to be responsible for their feelings.           |
| Are afraid to express their beliefs, opinions, and feelings when they differ from those of others. | I respect my own opinions and feelings and express them appropriately.                                                                                      |
| Accept sexual attention when they want love.                                                       | My sexuality is grounded in genuine intimacy and connection. When I need to feel loved, I express my heart’s desires. I do not settle for sex without love. |
| Make decisions without regard to the consequences.                                                 | I ask my Higher Power for guidance, and consider possible consequences before I make decisions.                                                             |
| Give up their truth to gain the approval of others or to avoid change.                             | I stand in my truth and maintain my integrity, whether others approve or not, even if it means making difficult changes in my life.                         |
