| Have difficulty identifying what they are feeling.                                      | I am aware of my feelings and identify them, often in the moment. I know the difference between my thoughts and feelings.                |
| Minimize, alter, or deny how they truly feel.                                           | I embrace my feelings; they are valid and important.                                                                                     |
| Perceive themselves as completely unselfish and dedicated to the well- being of others. | I know the difference between caring and caretaking. I recognize that caretaking others is often motivated by a need to benefit myself.  |
| Lack empathy for the feelings and needs of others.                                      | I am able to feel compassion for anotherâ€™s feelings and needs.                                                                           |
| Label others with their negative traits.                                                | I acknowledge that I may own the negative traits I often perceive in others.                                                             |
| Think they can take care of themselves without any help from others.                    | I acknowledge that I sometimes need the help of others.                                                                                  |
| Mask pain in various ways such as anger, humor, or isolation.                           | I am aware of my painful feelings and express them appropriately.                                                                        |
| Express negativity or aggression in indirect and passive ways.                          | I am able to express my feelings openly, directly, and calmly.                                                                           |
| Do not recognize the unavailability of those people to whom they are attracted.         | I pursue intimate relationships only with others who want, and are able to engage in, healthy and loving relationships.                  |
