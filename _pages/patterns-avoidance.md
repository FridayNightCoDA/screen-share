| Act in ways that invite others to reject, shame, or express anger toward them.                            | I act in ways that encourage loving and healthy responses from others.                                          |
| Judge harshly what others think, say, or do.                                                              | I keep an open mind and accept others as they are.                                                              |
| Avoid emotional, physical, or sexual intimacy as a way to maintain distance.                              | I engage in emotional, physical, or sexual intimacy when it is healthy and appropriate for me.                  |
| Allow addictions to people, places, and things to distract them from achieving intimacy in relationships. | I practice my recovery to develop healthy and fulfilling relationships.                                         |
| Use indirect or evasive communication to avoid conflict or confrontation.                                 | I use direct and straightforward communication to resolve conflicts and deal appropriately with confrontations. |
| Diminish their capacity to have healthy relationships by declining to use the tools of recovery.          | When I use the tools of recovery, I am able to develop and maintain healthy relationships of my choosing.       |
| Suppress their feelings or needs to avoid feeling vulnerable.                                             | I embrace my own vulnerability by trusting and honoring my feelings and needs.                                  |
| Pull people toward them, but when others get close, push them away.                                       | I welcome close relationships while maintaining healthy boundaries.                                             |
| Refuse to give up their self-will to avoid surrendering to a power greater than themselves.               | I believe in and trust a power greater than myself. I willingly surrender my self-will to my Higher Power.      |
| Believe displays of emotion are a sign of weakness.                                                       | I honor my authentic emotions and share them when appropriate.                                                  |
| Withhold expressions of appreciation.                                                                     | I freely engage in expressions of appreciation toward others.                                                   |
