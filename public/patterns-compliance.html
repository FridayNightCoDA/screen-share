<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Are extremely loyal, remaining in harmful situations too long.</td>
<td>I am committed to my safety and leave situations that feel unsafe or are inconsistent with my goals.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Compromise their own values and integrity to avoid rejection or anger.</td>
<td>I am rooted in my own values, even if others don’t agree or become angry.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Put aside their own interests in order to do what others want.</td>
<td>I consider my interests and feelings when asked to participate in another’s plans.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Are hypervigilant regarding the feelings of others and take on those feelings.</td>
<td>I can separate my feelings from the feelings of others. I allow myself to experience my feelings and others to be responsible for their feelings.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Are afraid to express their beliefs, opinions, and feelings when they differ from those of others.</td>
<td>I respect my own opinions and feelings and express them appropriately.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Accept sexual attention when they want love.</td>
<td>My sexuality is grounded in genuine intimacy and connection. When I need to feel loved, I express my heart’s desires. I do not settle for sex without love.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Make decisions without regard to the consequences.</td>
<td>I ask my Higher Power for guidance, and consider possible consequences before I make decisions.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Give up their truth to gain the approval of others or to avoid change.</td>
<td>I stand in my truth and maintain my integrity, whether others approve or not, even if it means making difficult changes in my life.</td>
